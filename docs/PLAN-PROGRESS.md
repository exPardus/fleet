# PLAN-PROGRESS — wave ledger (cross-session cursor)

The mutable cursor against the immutable contract `docs/PLAN.md`. A resuming manager reads this **first** (runbook step 2). Status vocab: `pending | dispatched | done | blocked | deferred`. Updated at each task close + gate; committed in every campaign's knowledge-loop step (§0.3h).

**Readiness boundary (this manager's mandate):** execute through **C2 merge gate**, then STOP for Soak Gate 1 sign-off. Do NOT start C3+. C1 doc-only in main repo; C2 code in worktree `C:\proga\claude-fleet-wt\c2`.

**Turn-one decisions (2026-07-08):** POSIX box = dev server 192.168.1.202; Max-20x plan, generous cap; new feature UL1 (usage-limit resilience) folded into C1 (`spec-amend-4-usagelimit`) + C2 (kernel item 11) — binding input `docs/reviews/USAGE-LIMIT-RESILIENCE-INTENT-2026-07-08.md`. See `knowledge/lessons.md`.
