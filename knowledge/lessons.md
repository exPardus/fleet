## 2026-07-08 — Self-build turn-one decisions (manager)

Decisions recorded per PLAN §0.5 (dated, on-disk, not session memory):
- **POSIX exercise box (C4):** Altai picked the **exPardus dev server 192.168.1.202** (real Linux, SSH-reachable) over the WSL fallback. `port-posix-smoke` dispatches there.
- **Budget:** Altai on **Claude Max 20x plan** — approved a **higher/generous cap** for the C1+C2 readiness boundary (declined the ~$330 sum-of-caps ceiling as a limit; treat caps as circuit-breakers, not a starved envelope). Per-task caps stay at §0.4 class defaults for the §0.1.8 2×-cap kill rule.
- **New feature — usage-limit resilience (plan ID UL1):** Altai requested "a way for the fleet to restart itself if it hits a usage limit for a 5 hour or weekly session." No review-doc finding exists; manager authored the single binding input `docs/reviews/USAGE-LIMIT-RESILIENCE-INTENT-2026-07-08.md`. **Folded into C1** as a new Wave-1A chain link `spec-amend-4-usagelimit` (sequential last, SPEC.md single-writer) and into **C2** as hardening-kernel item 11. Surfaced to Altai for ratification at the C1 checkpoint (touchpoint 4).
- **Dirty tree:** `workflows/idea-forge.workflow.js` (ROUNDS 3→2) committed at Altai's instruction; tree clean before C1.
- **Second new feature — worker subagents (plan ID UL2):** Altai requested (mid-C1, 2026-07-08) that fleet workers be able to use their own subagents (Task/Agent tool). No review-doc finding; manager authored binding input `docs/reviews/WORKER-SUBAGENTS-INTENT-2026-07-08.md`. **Folded into C1** as SPEC.md link `spec-amend-5-subagents` (sequential after the 1D SPEC.md fix wave). Key hazard: `fleet doctor`'s `_doctor_check_claude_agents` must not false-positive a worker's legitimate subagents; permission-mode inheritance under bypass is a security note. Likely C1 documentation-only (subagents are native Claude Code) — C2 code only if the probe shows a launch flag / doctor exemption is needed. Ratified with UL1 at the C1 checkpoint.

## 2026-07-07 — Campaign 0: building fleet itself (subagent-driven, 30+ agents)

The fleet CLI was built by a multi-agent pipeline (implementer → spec reviewer + adversarial reviewer in parallel → supervisor-adjudicator → fixer → re-review, per task). Lessons that transfer to running fleet campaigns:

**What worked**
- Adversarial reviewers with repro authority found what spec reviewers approved: 4 of 5 tasks got "Approved" from the spec lens while the adversarial lens returned proven BREAKS (lock races, path traversal, stdin pipe deadlock, silent hook death on spaced paths). Always run both lenses on anything that manages processes or files.
- Live smoke beats unit tests for stream-json assumptions: 340 green unit tests coexisted with three High/Medium bugs only a real haiku worker exposed (hook events land AFTER the result line; kill-dead resurrected by recompute; cost is per-invocation on --resume). Budget ~$0.10 of haiku time at the end of any campaign that touches worker plumbing.
- Supervisor-adjudicator agents (read both reviews, emit ONE binding fix list with exact semantics) kept fixers from re-interpreting findings. Fix lists anchored to function roles, not line numbers, survived concurrent refactors.
- Disjoint-file parallelism is safe (hooks + docs + core in parallel, exact-path staging, index.lock retry); same-file parallelism is not — sequence all bin/fleet.py work.

**What stalled**
- Same-file fix waves queued behind implementers repeatedly; the file-ownership handoff was the pipeline's bottleneck.
- One fixer died mid-run on an API error AFTER committing — always `git log` before re-dispatching "failed" work.
- Every fix wave introduced ~1 new issue (lock-hold sleep, unconditional re-claim); re-review after EVERY wave, no matter how small.

**Fleet-specific operational facts learned live**
- The Stop-block race is real: a `send` landing in the last seconds of a turn queues to the mailbox instead of same-turn delivery — this is by design (universal drain rule); check `idle+mail` in status, don't assume same-turn.
- `dead` is sticky (operator kill survives recompute); `respawn` is the only recovery lever. Pre-fix records persisted as idle may need a re-kill.
- Cost per worker = cost_baseline (respawn carry) + sum of result events in the current log.

**Rigorous-testing addendum (same campaign)**
- Multi-process stress found what thread-based unit tests could not: the spawn commit-lock timeout zombie only appears under real OS-process contention with real PowerShell probe latency. Any future concurrency change to fleet.py should re-run the stress harness (kept at the session scratchpad's `stress/`; the fake-claude stub must be a compiled .exe — a .cmd stub hangs under launch_turn's pipe shape).
- Fuzzing paid off at the parser layer, not the hooks: hooks survived 1000 hostile inputs untouched; the registry/cost parsers crashed on shape mismatches. Fuzz the parsers of any new event/registry field.
- `--max-budget-usd` overshoots ~3x on tiny caps — circuit breaker, not a ceiling.
- Stop-block mid-turn continuation PROVEN live: time a send after the last tool call, before Stop fires.

## 2026-07-08 — Campaign 1: haiku demo (3 workers, full lifecycle showcase)

First real end-to-end run on the finished CLI. Spawn → status → peek → mid-turn send → background wait → result → respawn → doctor → kill/clean, all green, total spend ~$0.21 haiku.

**What worked**
- Batched 3 spawns in one message; all landed in ~seconds, no lock contention.
- Mid-turn steering delivered and OBEYED: `send` to a working haiku poet ("make third haiku about the manager") queued to mailbox, consumed at next tool boundary, worker revised exactly the targeted item and confirmed in its final message. Steering prompt pattern worth reusing: prefix "Steering update from manager:" + one concrete, verifiable change.
- Task prompts ending in "Final message = X" made `result` output clean and directly consumable — haiku workers follow output-contract phrasing well.
- `fleet doctor` 13/13 PASS on first real campaign; `wt` absent is a known-fine fallback (detached PowerShell attach).

**What to know**
- `fleet` is NOT on PATH in the manager's PowerShell — call `C:\proga\claude-fleet\bin\fleet.cmd` by full path (or add bin to PATH).
- Respawn on an already-DONE task re-executes it rather than no-op'ing: respawned poet read its journal but rewrote poems.txt from scratch, losing the steered revision. Journal carries context, not idempotence — don't respawn a completed worker expecting state preservation; respawn is for stuck/long-context workers only.
- Haiku workers at these task sizes finish in under a minute — `status` right after arming `wait` often already shows idle; results can be harvested before the wait notification lands.

## 2026-07-08 — Campaign 1: SPEC v2.1 amendment pass (~15 workers, ~$60)

<!-- anchor: 2026-07-08-c1 -->
Folded every confirmed blocker/major from `docs/reviews/SPEC-REVIEW-2026-07-08.md` into
`docs/SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and 7 stubs. Doc-only, main repo, no merge gate. Waves:
1A (4-link sequential SPEC.md chain: state→schema→testing→usagelimit) →
1B (7 parallel stub-injectors) → 1C (split adversarial review: core ∥ stubs) →
1D (7 fixes to original builders via `fleet send` + re-review + 3 LOW polish) →
1E (manager verification). Two features folded mid-campaign at Altai's request:
UL1 (usage-limit park+resume) and UL2 (worker subagents).

**Process changes — amend `knowledge/playbooks/campaign-template.md` (do these next campaign)**

1. **Descriptive-vs-prescriptive labeling in spec-amendment task files (the #1 C1 lesson).**
   Wave-1C's 3 majors all reduced to ONE root cause: the amendment folded BOTH
   already-shipped-behavior findings (DESCRIPTIVE — "bring spec to code") AND
   not-yet-built fixes (PRESCRIPTIVE — the fix is a future kernel) under a header
   claiming "no code change proposed / correct code passes." A build/verify session
   then can't tell which invariants are enforced-today vs TODO.
   **Amendment:** every spec-amendment task file must instruct the worker to tag each
   folded finding `[UNBUILT — owned by <kernel/campaign>]` when the fix is not yet in
   shipped code, and to split any "required regressions" list into "passes today" vs
   "pins unbuilt fixes." Instructing this UPFRONT would have prevented the entire 1D
   fix wave. This is the amendment to the task-file convention.

2. **Doc-adapted chain-link truth gate.** PLAN §0.1.9's truth gate assumes `pytest`;
   C1 was doc-only. Working substitute:
   (a) **anchor+witness grep per finding** — presence of the `<!-- F## -->` anchor AND
       the designated witness sentence (anchor presence alone is content-blind); and
   (b) **manager spot-checks any spec-vs-code CLAIM against `bin/fleet.py`** by grepping
       the named function anchor BEFORE ordering a fix. In C1 this confirmed CM1/CM2 were
       real before dispatch, and caught that a "code bug" complaint was actually
       correct-but-C2-deferred.
   Add this as the doc-campaign variant of the truth gate in campaign-template.md.

**Operational facts (reusable)**

- **Mid-campaign feature folding pattern:** a feature request with NO review-doc finding →
  manager authors a single binding intent note (`docs/reviews/*-INTENT-*.md`, mirroring
  §0.2.4's one-binding-input rule) and routes it through the same spec→review→fix gate as
  a real finding. Used for UL1 + UL2; both passed review clean/sound. Reusable.
- **`fleet result` crashes on Windows console (cp1252) when output contains unicode**
  (→ arrows): `'charmap' codec can't encode`. Workaround: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.
  Real `bin/fleet.py` bug (stdout encoding), C2-worktree fix candidate — logged in
  `knowledge/projects/claude-fleet.md` (c1-playbook owns that file; cross-ref).
- **7-wide parallel disjoint-file commits: zero index.lock casualties** — confirms the
  Campaign-0 disjoint-file-parallelism lesson holds at 7 concurrent workers with
  exact-path staging + retry.
- **Cost-watch cadence worked:** `fleet wait --timeout 300` poll loop + `fleet peek`
  proxies caught no runaways; a timeout wake landing on an "essentially done, committing"
  worker just needs a short re-arm to catch completion. Note: resume turns are
  budget-UNCAPPED until `harden-fleet-b` (M5) — small doc fixes were low-risk here.
- **UL2 outcome:** worker subagents are default-on (native Task/Agent tool, no launch
  flag); ephemeral subagents don't register in `claude agents --json`, so the doctor
  check never false-positives them — C1 documentation-only, no C2 code owed.

- **UL1 + UL2 RATIFIED** by Altai at the C1 checkpoint (2026-07-08) — both approved as specced; C2 greenlit. UL1 kernel builds in C2 (item 11); UL2 was documentation-only (no C2 code owed).
